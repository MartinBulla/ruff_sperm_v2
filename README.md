## Supporting information for "Sperm traits of the three genetic morphs in the ruff sandpiper "

### **Overview**

Contains data collection and preregistration protocols, recordings and pictures of sperm to estimate motility and measure morphology of sperm in three ruff morphs, meta-data on individual males, and computer code to generate outputs of the analysis. 

### **Folders and files**

[Data](Data/): raw data and manipulated data generated with R-scripts starting on "DAT_"; sim folder contains mcmc chains

[R](R/): R-scripts used in the analysis; those starting on 
- "DAT" prepare data for analysis, 
- "Fig or Table" create figures or tables,
- "MET_sample-sizes.R" provides sample sizes for the Methods and Results section
- "EXP_relatedness_effects.R" explores mixing of the mcmcm chains in the analyses that control for relatedness
- "tools.R" tools necessary for most of the R-scripts and sources within those
- "Out_velocity-videos.Rmd" script to create html docuement showing the ruff and zebra finch motility
- "Preregistration_v3.Rmd" script to create html document of a priory methods of data collection and analyses
- "protocol_sperm.Rmd" script to create html document of sperm sampling, sample preparation, and picture taking protocol
- "_runRmarkdown.R generates htmls from Rmd scripts

[Outputs](Outputs/): all outputs used in the manuscript

[Protocols](Protocols/): Protocols used in this study
